# Software Development Guide

> Pulsar Linux is an application-ready platform so it comes with tools you can use to develop and run Linux applications on a variety of devices, from carrier grade to traditional embedded and many types in between. The GNU toolchain is available with Pulsar Linux. Among other ancillary tools and libraries, the toolchain includes the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) compiler system.

## Native Application Development

> You can develop applications directly on the device instead of working in a cross-compiling
environment.

### Example: Locally Develop Source Files and Build

> The following is an example of writing and building an application directly on the device. For
demonstrative purposes, a sample application from the gcc-example package is used. By default,
sample applications from the gcc-example package are installed in the /opt/samples directory.

### Example: Copy Source Files From a Git Repository and Build

> The following example builds an application from source files that were copied from a thirdparty
Git repository. The application is an ASCII game called msnake. Secondarily, the example
also demonstrates how quickly you can install additional packages to help with application
development.
